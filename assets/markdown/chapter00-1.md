The application we will be building requires a non-trivial amount of boilerplate. Instead of spending time setting up your environment, which is not the purpose of this tutorial, we have created a boilerplate project to get you started.

You can find the boilerplate project on Github at [brwr/thinkster-django-angular-boilerplate](https://github.com/brwr/thinkster-django-angular-boilerplate). The repository includes a list of commands you need to run to get everything running.

Go ahead and follow the setup instructions now.

Follow the instructions to set up your environment

## Checkpoint
If all went well running the server with `python manage.py runserver` should allow you to visit `http://localhost:8000/` in your browser. The page will be blank except for the navigation bar at the top. The links in the navigation bar currently do nothing.

Make sure your environment is running by visiting `http://localhost:8000/`
